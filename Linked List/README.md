# Homework 5 Linked List

linkedlist.c file is an example C program we have covered on the lab session.

I have updated and add 4 functions with function prototypes below.

void insert_after();
void insert_before();
void delete_key();
void sort();

Please complete the function prototypes.
Only change codes after line 173.
Compile your code and include your executable binary file.
